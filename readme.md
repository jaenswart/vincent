===V.I.N.Cent===

VINCent is an JavaScript API and CLI interface which makes the generation of config files for dev ops configuration management tools, such as Ansible, Puppet and 
Chef easier to create, easier to maintain and easier to query. Vincent provides a layer of abstraction for these tools with configurations stored in JSON format. The framework
has been built to allow for the development of engine plugins that will generate appropriate configuration files for the different tools. Currently Ansible support is being 
developed and it is hoped, if the project is a success, that other engines will be added later.

The JSON configuration files can be built up interactively on the CLI or programmaticlly via script files. By allowing configurations to be programmed with a scripting language 
such as JavaScript much of the frustration of shoehorning logic into YML files and dealing with the vargaries of the YML files syntax can be avoided and configuration maitenance can
be made much more fun and productive. Well that is the theory - how successfuly VINCent will be at this remains to be seen.

The project is still in a development stage and needs many more modules to be added to be useful. We had hoped to be in a more useful state but we have decided to publish what we have
as our celebration of Mandela Day 2016.
