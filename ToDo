ToDo Items in no particular order


* Make role names and role capabilities dynamic
* Implement in app downloading of new and updated modules
* Log results of config run to database
* Implement test for ldap and unix auth with docker containers
* check permissions on config direcotries especially keys and refuse to start if permissions are incorrect

----------------


For unix accounts authentication to work correctly the user which V.I.N.Cent runs as must be part of the shadow groups
to have the required permissions to read the shadow passwords file.

On first use users,group and hosts will have owner:root and group:vincent with permissions 664. This can be changed by
editing the configuration file

For npm install to wor you will need the pam development library installed.
"sudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev"
"sudo apt-get install build-essential"

npm install
generate ssl certificats: openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout vincent.key -x509 -days 3650 -out vincent.crt

edit config.ini to point to your ssl certificates.

To Run Tests

create postgresql role 'vincent' with password 'pass' or change the configuration information in the config.ini file.
create a database 'vincent' owned by role 'vincnet' or change configuration details in config.ini. Postgres should be
listening on port 5432 or change the entry in the config.ini.

Make sure the user running tests has permissions to run docker commands. On Ubunut make them a member of the docker
group "usermod -a -G docker [login]"
